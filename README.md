VAPor: Video Audio Photo online repository: web based media player for the home

This project is motivated by my percieved lack of a good way to play home videos and view digital photos on our family XBox One. I want a method to view videos, play my home studio audio productions, and look at family photos on my Xbox without being locked into the Windows 10 ecosystem.  I like Linux, and want to be able to enjoy our family's home produced media on any device that can access a web page.
